# Deprecated setState() in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications: the use of a deprecated `setState` method. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

The bug arises from directly using `this.setState()` in a functional component or class component with hooks. This method is deprecated and can lead to unexpected behavior, such as stale closures and inconsistent state updates.  The solution uses the functional update pattern or `useState` hook to ensure that state updates are always based on the most current state.
